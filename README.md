# aiogram_randombot
Telegram bot is based on 'The library if Babel' and 'Infinite monkey theorem'\n
'The library if Babel' narrates about library, which stores books, that contains all possible symbols combinations. Despite most of them contains just random combinations and nothing useful, some of them contains all information about whole universe, about life of every person, who ever lived or would live on Earth, all written books by humans and just everything, that you can imagine, is already stored in those books
'Infinite monkey theorem' states that a monkey hitting keys independently and at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, including the complete works of William Shakespeare
As you can see those two paradoxes about randomness are quite astonishing, therefore I decided to recreate it in telegram bot using python with aiogram and psycopg2
Telegram bot can generate random texts and images, stores them in database, and allows to view them all
Who knows what can be generated there
